# Stock-Price-Predictor

Built a Long Short Term Network (LSTM) architecture to predict the trends of Google's stock price for the month of November 2019 with a ~95% relative accuracy.

# Getting Started
- Download built_lstm.py, Full_Google_Test_Data.csv, and Full_Google_Training_Data.csv into the same folder
- Run built_lstm.py

# Built With
- **The environment:** [Spyder IDE](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
- **Data Processing:** [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) 
- **Model Training/Iterating:** [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- **Data Visualization:** [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- **Education:** Part of the [Deep Learning A-Z Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/)

# Next Steps For Improvement
- Create a more robust predictor, taking into account more factors other than the stock price such as other relevant companies/financial indicators
- Implement techniques such as k-fold cross validation as I did for my previous project Customer Churn Predictor
- Building a completely different model through reinforcement learning
