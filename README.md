# Stock-Price-Predictor

Built an Long Short Term Network architecture to predict the trends of Google's stock price for the month of November 2019 with
a ~95% relative accuracy.

Developed in the Spyder IDE using NumPy, Pandas and Scikit-learn for data processing, Keras and Scikit-learn for 
training/iterating on model, and Matplotlib for visualizing the results.

Running built_lstm.py and importing the Full_Google_Test_Data.csv and Full_Google_Training_Data.csv datasets should enable you 
to be able to plug and play with it as well.

Steps to further improve on this model and skillset would be to create a more robust predictor, taking into account more 
factors other than the stock price (ex: looking at other relevant companies/financial indicators), and to implement 
k means validation as I did for my previous project Customer Churn Predictor. Another thing to look into is building a 
completely different model through reinforcement learning, and simulating the model buying stocks so that I could evaluate 
its performance.
